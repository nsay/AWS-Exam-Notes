## Amazon S3
- ”infinitely scaling” storage
- Backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage • Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics • Software delivery
- Static website

#### S3 Buckets
- allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
- buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- defined at region-level

**S3 Bucket Objects:**
- Objects (files) have a Key
- key is composed of prefix + object name
- Metadata
- Tags
- Version ID

**S3 Bucket Security:**
- User-Based
  - IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
- Resource-Based
  - Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account 
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled)
  - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)
- Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

**S3 Bucket Policies:**
- JSON based policies
- By default, blocks all public access

#### S3 - Static Website Hosting
- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet
- 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!

#### S3 - Versioning
- version your files in Amazon S3
- Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version) - Easy roll back to previous version

#### S3 - Replication (CRR & SRR)
- Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets 
- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
  - compliance, lower latency access, replication across
accounts
- Same-Region Replication (SRR)
  - log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

#### S3 - Storage Classes
**General Purpose:**
- Used for frequently accessed data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Use Cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution

**Infrequent Access:**
- data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
- **Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA):**
  - Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups
- **One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA):**
  - Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate

**Glacier Storage:**
- Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
- **Glacier Instant Retrieval:**
  - Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter 
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days
- **Glacier Flexible Retrieval:**
  - Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) – free 
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days
- **Glacier Deep Archive:**
  - long term storage
  - Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours)
  - Minimum storage duration of 180 days

**Intelligent-Tiering:**
- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
- Frequent Access tier (automatic): 
  - default tier
- Infrequent Access tier (automatic): 
  - objects not accessed for 30 days
- Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): 
  - objects not accessed for 90 days 
- Archive Access tier (optional): 
  - configurable from 90 days to 700+ days 
- Deep Archive Access tier (optional): 
  - config. from 180 days to 700+ days

#### Encryption
- server side:
  - server encrypts the file after receiving it
- client side:
  - client encrypted the file before sending it

#### IAM Access Analyzer
- Ensures that only intended people have access to your S3 buckets

#### Shared Responsibility Model for S3
**AWS:**
- Infrastructure (global security, durability, availability, sustain concurrent loss of data in two facilities)
- Configuration and vulnerability analysis
- Compliance validation

**YOU:**
- S3 Versioning
- S3 Bucket Policies
- S3 Replication Setup
- Logging and Monitoring • S3 Storage Classes
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

#### Snow Family
- Highly-secure, physical portable devices to collect and process data at the
edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS
- Data migration:
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge
  - Snowmobile
- Edge computing:
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge

**Snowcone:**
- Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments
- Must provide your own battery / cables
- Snowcone 
  - 8 TB of HDD Storage
- Snowcone SSD 
  - 14 TB of SSD Storage

**Snowball Edge:**
- move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
- Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
- Storage Optimized
  - 80 TB of HDD capacity
- Compute Optimized
  - 42 TB of HDD or 28TB NVMe capacity
- Use cases: 
  - large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery

Pricing:
- You pay for device usage and data transfer **OUT** of AWS
- IN to AWS is FREE

**Snowmobile:**
- Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
- Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
- High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance 
- Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB

#### Edge Computing
- Process data while it’s being created on an Edge Location.
- Edge Location means
  - Limited / no internet access
  - Limited / no easy access to computing power
- Only Snowcone or Snowball Edge devices
- Use cases:
  -  Preprocess data, Machine learning at the edge, Transcoding media streams
- Long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing

#### OpsHub
- software to manage Snow Family Device

#### Storage Gateway
- Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
- Hybrid storage service to allow on- premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
- Use cases: 
  - disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
