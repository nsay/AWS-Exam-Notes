## Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Mainly consists in the capability of: 
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

#### EC2 User Data
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as: 
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
  - Anything you can think of
- Only run once at the instance first start

#### EC2 Instant Types

**General Purpose:**
- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between: 
  - Compute
  - Memory
  - Networking
- Example: t2.micro

**Compute Optimized:**
- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require **high performance** processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing (HPC)
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers

**Memory Optimized:**
- Fast performance for workloads that process **large data sets** in memory:
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

**Storage Optimized:**
- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require **high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage**:
  - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  - Relational & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems

#### EC2 Security Groups
- Acts as a Firewall for EC2 instances
- Security groups only contain **ALLOW** rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
- Can be attached to multiple instances
- If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
- If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is authorized by default


#### Port Numbers
- **22 = SSH (Secure Shell)** - log into a Linux instance
- **21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** – upload files into a file share
- **22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)** – upload files using SSH
- **80 = HTTP** – access unsecured websites
- **443 = HTTPS** – access secured websites
- **3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** – log into a Windows instance

#### EC2 Purchasing Options
- **On-Demand Instances** 
  - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- **Reserved (1 & 3 years)**
  - Reserved Instances – long workloads
  - Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
- **Savings Plans (1 & 3 years)** 
  - commitment to an amount of usage, long workload 
- **Spot Instances** 
  - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- **Dedicated Hosts** 
  - book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- **Dedicated Instances** 
  - no other customers will share your hardware
- **Capacity Reservations** 
  - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

**EC2 On Demand:**
- Pay for what you use:
  - Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute 
  - All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave

**EC2 Reserved Instances:**
- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
- You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region,Tenancy, OS)
- Reservation Period – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
- Payment Options – No Upfront (+), Par tial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++) 
- Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)

**EC2 Savings Plans:**
- discount based on long-term usage
- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region

**EC2 Spot Instances:**
- discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure: 
  - Batch jobs
  - Data analysis
  - Image processing
  - Any distributed workloads
  - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
- Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

**EC2 Dedicated Hosts:**
- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- Allows you address **compliance requirements and use your existing server- bound software licenses** (per-socket, per-core, pe—VM software licenses)
- Purchasing Options:
  - On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
  - Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront,All Upfront)
- The most expensive option
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)
- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

**EC2 Dedicated Instances:**
- Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

**EC2 Capacity Reservations:**
- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any
duration
- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

**EC2 Purchasing Options Comparison:**
- **On Demand:** coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- **Reserved:** like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
- **Savings Plans:** pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View, ...)
- **Spot instances:** the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms.You can get kicked out at any time
- **Dedicated Hosts:** We book an entire building of the resort
- **Capacity Reservations:** you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it

#### Shared Responsibility Model for EC2
**AWS:**
- Infrastructure (global network security)
- Isolation on physical hosts
- Replacing faulty hardware
- Compliance validation

**YOU**
- Security Groups rules
- Operating-system patches and
- Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance
- IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management
- Data security on your instance

#### EC2 - Summary
- **EC2 Instance:** AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage + security groups + EC2 User Data
- **Security Groups:** Firewall attached to the EC2 instance
- **EC2 User Data:** Script launched at the first start of an instance
- **SSH:** start a terminal into our EC2 Instances (port 22)
- **EC2 Instance Role:** link to IAM roles
- **Purchasing Options:** On-Demand, Spot, Reserved (Standard + Convertible), Dedicated Host, Dedicated Instance
