**Multi Account Strategies:**
- Create different accounts per department, enviroment, user, etc etc using SCP to seperate access levels

**Consolidated Billing:**
- Combined Usage:
  - combine the usage across all AWS accounts in the AWS Organization to share the volume pricing, Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discounts
- One Bill:
  - get one bill for all AWS Accounts in the AWS Organization

#### Service Control Policies (SCP)
- Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
- Applied at the **OU or Account** level
- Does not apply to the Master Account
- SCP is applied to all the **Users and Roles** of the Account, including Root user
- The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
- SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
- Use cases:
  - Restrict access to certain services (for example: can’t use EMR) 
  - Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services
